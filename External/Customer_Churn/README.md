# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction Project
## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for a telecom customer churn prediction project. In this project, we used various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Decision Trees, to predict customer churn in a telecom company.
## Methodology
1.Preprocessing and Cleaning

2.Feature visualization

3.Splitting of data

4.Data observation on each epoch

5.Analysis of accuracy on every model Logistic Regression,KNeighbors Classifier, RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, 
  Decision Tree Classifier

## Libraries used
1.Sklearn

2.NumPy

3.Pandas

4.Matplotlib

5.Seaborn
